The central theme of my research is geophysical fluid dynamics with a focus on the oceanâ€™s role in global climate. Below is a favourite shadowy picture of hammerhead sharks, followed by a brief academic biography. Thank you for visiting :)

I completed my PhD at the [School of Earth and Ocean Science, University of Victoria, BC, Canada](https://www.uvic.ca/science/seos/index.php) in 2009. It focussed on numerical modelling of the ocean's overturning circulation at different resolutions.

In 2009, I began working at the [Climate Change Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia](https://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/) as a post-doctoral researcher. In 2015, I received an Australian Research Council Discovering Early Career Researchers award to study Antarctic Bottom Water dynamics. I was promoted to Senior Lecturer at UNSW in 2016. 

In 2019, I received an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship award to study the Antarctic Slope Current. In 2021, I started working at the [Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania](https://www.imas.utas.edu.au/).
